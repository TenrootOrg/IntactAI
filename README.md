## Requirements

- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **RAM:** 16GB minimum (32GB recommended)
- **CPU:** 4+ cores
- **Disk:** 100GB+ available space
- **Network:** Static IP address

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo (gets the latest `main`)
git clone https://github.com/TenrootOrg/IntactAI.git intact
# To install a specific release instead, add `--branch <tag>`,
# e.g.:
# git clone --branch intact-20260609 https://github.com/TenrootOrg/IntactAI.git intact
# Or to track the development branch (latest, unreleased changes):
# git clone --branch development https://github.com/TenrootOrg/IntactAI.git intact

cd intact

# 2. Edit configuration (set your IP/domain and passwords)
nano config.yaml

# 3. Run installer
sudo bash install.sh
```

### Air-gapped installation

> Supported from `intact-20260813` onward.

`--package` makes the installer take every image and dependency from the file
you carry in, never from a registry.

On a machine with internet:

```bash
git clone --branch <tag> https://github.com/TenrootOrg/IntactAI.git intact
cd intact
bash scripts/prepare_package.sh <tag> /media/usb    # writes intact-upgrade-<tag>.tar
```

Carry **both** the checkout and the `.tar` across — `install.sh` lives in the
checkout. Then on the air-gapped box:

```bash
cd /path/to/intact
nano config.yaml                                    # IP/domain and passwords
sudo bash install.sh --package /media/usb/intact-upgrade-<tag>.tar
```

`--package` is repeatable and also takes a directory of per-module assets. If
Docker is not already installed, carry the release's `<tag>-system-bundle.tar`
too and put it beside the package — it provides the engine and host packages
offline.

## Services & Ports

Everything terminates TLS through the main nginx. Access is `https://YOUR_IP`
unless a port is listed. `install.sh` starts containers only for enabled
modules.

| Module | What it does | Access | Containers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Web UI — workflows, blueprints, reports, settings | `/` | `intact_backend`, `intact_tusd`, `intact_nginx` |
| **Velociraptor** | Endpoint forensics + remote collection | `/velociraptor/` (proxied — not the upstream port) | `intact_velociraptor` |
| **TimeSketch** | Timeline analysis — ingests Plaso super-timelines, pivots across hosts from one view | `:5000` | `intact_timesketch_web`, `_web_v3`, `_web_legacy`, `_worker`, `_nginx`, `_postgres`, `_redis`, `_opensearch` |
| **ELK** | Searchable log store + Kibana. Indexes Velociraptor hunts and Sigma matches | `:5601` | `intact_elasticsearch`, `intact_logstash`, `intact_kibana` |
| **IRIS** | Case management — incidents, assignees, evidence chains, runbook progress | `:8443` | `intact_iris_app`, `_db`, `_worker`, `_rabbitmq`, `_nginx` |
| **VolWeb** | Memory forensics (Volatility 3 + YARA) | `:8002` | `intact_volweb_frontend`, `_backend`, `_workers`, `_workers_yarascan`, `_postgresdb`, `_redis` |
| **Portainer** | Container management — inspect, restart, tail logs | `:9443` | `intact_portainer`, `intact_portainer_agent` |
| **Case Analysis (Fusion)** | Correlates every host + module into one incident graph → fused report, advisory, timeline, Identities, and grounded chat | in Dashboard | — |
| **Memory** | Remote acquisition (AVML / WinPmem), analysed in the VolWeb stack | in Dashboard | — |
| **Cloud DFIR** | AWS **CloudTrail** and Microsoft 365 / Azure AD **(DFIR-O365RC)** collection + SIGMA detections | in Dashboard | in `intact_backend` |
| **Plaso** | Super-timeline generation | via TimeSketch | image pulled per job |
| **Scheduler / Blueprints / Agentic** | Scheduled collections, reusable blueprints, agentic quick-wins | in Dashboard | — |

> The search engines — TimeSketch's OpenSearch and ELK's Elasticsearch/Kibana —
> are the biggest RAM/CPU consumers. On a small host, `docker stop` the stacks
> you are not using.


**Firewall.** `443` in from analysts (Dashboard, `/velociraptor/`, `/api/`) and
`8000` in from endpoint subnets — Velociraptor agents phone home on 8000, and if
it is blocked they silently never appear in the Clients list. `80` redirects to
HTTPS. The module ports above should be locked to the analyst subnet.

`443` outbound is used during install and upgrade, and by enabled modules that
call out (LLM providers, Microsoft Graph, AWS). It can be skipped entirely if
you install and upgrade from packages.

## Upgrades

One release at a time (N → N+1). Each hop is tested as a single step; skipping
releases is not.

> **Air-gapped upgrades are supported from `intact-20260813` onward.** A box on
> an earlier release must reach GitHub for at least one hop to get to
> `20260813`; from there every subsequent upgrade can be carried in on a
> package with no network at all.

Four routes, all the same engine underneath (`scripts/upgrade.sh`):

| Route | Where | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| **Online Upgrade** | Dashboard → Settings | The box can reach GitHub |
| **Prepare Package** | Dashboard → Settings | Build one file to carry to an air-gapped box |
| **Import Package** | Dashboard → Settings | Apply a package you carried in |
| **CLI** | shell | Air-gapped boxes, scripted runs, recovery, single-module repair |

The CLI route needs **neither the backend nor the dashboard**. `scripts/upgrade.sh`
talks only to Docker and to this checkout, so it works when the platform is
broken — which is when you most need it: the backend stopped or crash-looping,
nginx down and no dashboard, you on SSH with no browser. The dashboard routes
above are a convenience wrapper that launches the same engine.

```bash
sudo bash scripts/upgrade.sh <tag>                     # online
sudo bash scripts/upgrade.sh --package <file|dir>      # air-gap

sudo bash scripts/prepare_package.sh <tag>             # build one carry-in file
```

**Which modules get upgraded.** Automatically — the engine compares each
module's installed version against the package's and moves only the ones that
differ. Everything else is left alone. To choose yourself:

```bash
--only a,b        # just these
--skip a,b        # everything except these
--reinstall a,b   # re-apply one already at target (repairs a half-landed upgrade)
```

## Scripts

### Change Platform IP

Repoints an installed platform to a new IP — and doubles as the repair tool:
re-run it with the **current** IP to regenerate certs, configs and containers
when something is broken.

```bash
sudo bash scripts/change_ip.sh 192.168.120.11
```

> Velociraptor agents already on endpoints have the old IP baked in and will
> **not** reconnect. Redeploy them with the new installers in
> `client_installers/`, or keep the old IP reachable as an alias.

### Clean/Uninstall

To remove Intact.AI components (containers, volumes, data):

```bash
sudo bash scripts/clean.sh                 # interactive
sudo bash scripts/clean.sh --all --force   # full uninstall, no prompts
```

Scopes: `--all`, `--containers`, `--volumes`, `--images`, `--data`, `--logs`.
